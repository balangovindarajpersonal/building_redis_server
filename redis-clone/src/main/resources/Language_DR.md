# ADR 1: Use Java for Redis Clone Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Building a Redis clone that needs to be efficient in handling concurrent data operations. The requirements include supporting basic commands like PING, ECHO, SET, and GET with the potential for scaling to more complex operations in the future.

The implementation language needs to provide:

- Strong concurrency support for handling multiple client connections.
- Robust standard libraries for network and data structure management.
- Mature ecosystem with tools for testing, building, and deployment.

After considering several languages and their ecosystems, I have decided to use Java.

## Decision

I will use Java for the implementation of our Redis clone. The primary reason for this decision is my familiarity with the language, which will accelerate development and reduce the learning curve.

Java also offers robust multithreading capabilities, which are crucial for achieving the high performance and concurrency required by a Redis clone. Furthermore, Java's extensive standard library and mature ecosystem provide a wealth of tools and libraries that can help us implement and maintain the project effectively.

## Consequences

By choosing Java, I expect the following consequences:

- **Positive Consequences:**
    - Faster initial development due to existing knowledge and experience
    - Ability to leverage Java's strong concurrency mechanisms, which could lead to a more performant and scalable product.
    - Access to a rich ecosystem of development and debugging tools.

- **Negative Consequences:**
    - Java applications can have a larger memory footprint compared to some languages like Go or Rust, which could be a concern for a data store.
