# Java Redis Clone

A simplistic Redis clone implemented in Java, providing a minimalistic in-memory key-value store with support for basic commands like PING, ECHO, SET, and GET.

## Features

- In-memory key-value storage
- Support for basic Redis commands:
  - `PING`: Checks the connection to the server.
  - `ECHO`: Echoes the given string.
  - `SET`: Sets the string value of a key.
  - `GET`: Gets the string value of a key.

## Getting Started
